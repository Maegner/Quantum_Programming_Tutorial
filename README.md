# Hello Quantum - Qiskit Edition

This folder contains an upgraded version of the [command line Hello Quantum tutorial](https://medium.com/qiskit/visualizing-bits-and-qubits-9af287047b28). It has been made for Jupyter notebooks.

The idea is that this could be the basis for
* Presentations given by IBMers (which their own custom-made Hello Quantum levels)
* A tutorial for potential users to self-study.

Current content here could be used for either of the above cases. It is organized in a series of chapters, each building on the last.

* [Chapter 1: Bits](Bits.ipynb)
* [Chapter 2: Single Qubit Gates](2_Single-Qubit-Gates.ipynb)
* [Chapter 3: Two Qubit Gates](3_Two-Qubit-Gates.ipynb)
* [Chapter 4: Beyond Clifford](4_Beyond-Clifford.ipynb)
* [Chapter 5: Bell Test](5_Bell-Test.ipynb)

Comments required. The more critical, the better!
